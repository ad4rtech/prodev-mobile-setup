## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to create a first mobile application using the Expo Router template, understand the project structure, and run the app on a physical device.

---

## 🚀 Project Scaffolding Steps

1. Navigated to the parent project directory:
   ```bash
   cd prodev-mobile-setup

2. Created a new project directory:

mkdir prodev-mobile-app-0x00
cd prodev-mobile-app-0x00

3. Initialized a new Expo application using Expo Router:

npx create-expo-app@latest app-example

4. Selected the Expo Router template with TypeScript support.

## ✏️ Modifying the Home Screen

Opened the file:

app/(tabs)/index.tsx

Changed the default text from Welcome! to:

First App Created

## ▶️ Running the Application

The development server was started using:

npx expo start


The app was successfully tested on a physical mobile device using Expo Go.

## 🔄 Reset Project Observation

The following command was executed:

npm run reset-project

## Observations:

-The Metro bundler cache was cleared.

-The app restarted with a clean state.

-No project files were deleted.

-This helps resolve potential caching or runtime issues.
